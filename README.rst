===========================
Sage DnD  Module Repository
===========================

This is simple project to play with the statistics of DnD attribute rolls.


Usage
-----

Within the SageMath environment, the basic usage is illustrated by the following:

    sage: import sagednd.dnd_ability_rolls                                            
    sage: get_dnd_ability_rolls = sagednd.dnd_ability_rolls.get_dnd_ability_rolls     
    sage: dnd_ability_roll_score = sagednd.dnd_ability_rolls.dnd_ability_roll_score   
    sage: rolls = get_dnd_ability_rolls()                                             
    sage: roll_scores = [dnd_ability_roll_score(r) for r in rolls]  


Features
--------

It's got it all, everything, the full monty! ...and yet minimal...

Demonstration
-------------

The Jupyter Notebook

    jupyter notebook sagednd_demo.ipynb

contains example code and some data visualizations.

Installation
------------

    python setup.py install --user

Documentation
-------------

In addition to this file (./README.rst), the documentation is generated by Sphinx. From within ./docs run

    make html

This will make a file called ./docs/_build/html/index.html that is the html entry point to the documentation.

Copyright & License
-------------------

The project has the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE found in the file LICENSE.

Version Control
---------------

./ is a Git repository. It was created by making a .gitignore file and then entering

    $ git init
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "First commit"

Environment
-----------

There is an environment.yml file that was made by 

    $ conda config --add channels conda-forge
    $ conda create --name sagednd sage
    $ source activate sagednd
    $ conda env export > environment.yml

and setup with:

    $ conda env create -f environment.yml

Management
----------

The Makefile allows make to take .sage files in ./ and "preparse" them into .py files in ./sagednd:

    make preparsed

creates ./sagednd/dnd_ability_rolls.py from ./dnd_ability_rolls.sage
    
Testing
-------

With pytest, we can run

    python -m pytest

This runs the tests in ./tests/test_dndsage.py
